# 🎮 Experience-Playground

**A curated playground of interactive learning and creativity prototypes.**
*Part of the CMET system (Content, Marketing, Experience, Technology), where BeyondDictionary × LLOS.AI interlinks words, games, creativity, and scalable AI architecture into one living ecosystem.*

This repo brings together lightweight experiments that merge education, storytelling, and play. Each file demonstrates how GenAI can transform abstract concepts into **living engagement** — designed not as one-off tools, but as proof-points for the future of pedagogy and storytelling.

## 🧮 Math & Logic Builders

* **Lightweight Quiz Prototype** — A mobile-first quiz engine showcasing flexible formats and adaptive questioning. It feels light yet hints at scale — the seed of a 100M+ question universe.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/light_quiz_medium.html)

* **BODMAS Animated Trainer** — Turns order of operations into visual, bilingual play. Learners see rules come alive and internalize logic through guided exploration.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/bodmas_trainer.html)

* **Little Math Explorer (Ages 6–8)** — A hands-on calculator for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Not rote drilling, but joyful experimentation with numbers.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/common_math_operations_for_6_to_8_year_old_addition_subtraction_division_multiplication_and_knowledge_calculator.html)

* **Coordinate Geometry Explainer** — Abstract plotting becomes tangible. Learners toggle bilingual views, access glossary terms, and plot points interactively.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/math_concept_article_coordinate_geometry.html)

* **Toddler Counting Simulator (Ages 3–5)** — A playful, visual environment where young children grasp quantity through ten-frames and place-value activities.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/counting_more_less_basic_math_for_age_3_to_5.html)

* **Newton’s Laws Free Body Calculator** — Brings physics to life. Forces, vectors, and reactions become sliders and visuals, making theory experiential.

## 📝 Language & Word Explorers

* **Brilliant Bowl (Synonyms & Antonyms)** — Words flow in and out of a bowl, making nuance visible and polarity memorable. A metaphor turned into interaction.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/bowl_fill_synonymn_antonymn.html)

* **Crakk Misspelling Explorer** — Learners play with errors, discovering resilience in spelling. Mistakes become anchors for stronger recall.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/crakk_misspelling.html)

* **Polysemous Words Explorer** — A gentle, reflective journey into words with multiple meanings. Context and flexibility become the lesson.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/polysemous_words.html)

* **Speak Words Trainer** — Voice-enabled learning where pronunciation and listening converge. Immediate feedback turns passive study into active growth.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/speak_words.html)

* **Part-of-Speech Cube Game** — A rotating 3D cube turns grammar into touch and motion. Learners explore categories in a way that feels tactile and spatial.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/part_of_speech_cube_game_interactive_teacher.html)

* **Synonym Finder Game** — A drag-and-drop challenge where synonyms drop like tiles. Quick play builds instinctive language agility.
  [*Live Demo ➔*](https://pawan-nayar.github.io/experience-playground/synonym_finder_game.html)

## 🚀 Vision

This repo is a **laboratory for BeyondDictionary × LLOS.AI** — testing grounds where small prototypes prove a bigger point:
That learning, creativity, and engagement can be **living, interactive, and generative**.

What you see here are not classroom exercises. They are **signals of a future** where GenAI enables:

* ✨ Personalization at scale
* 📱 Seamless, mobile-first interactivity
* 🌍 Multilingual inclusivity
* 🎨 Design that builds trust and clarity
